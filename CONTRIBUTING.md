# IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CONTRIBUTE

This project needs volunteers in the form of designers, frontend developers, backend php developers who are familiar with both Zend and Laravel frameworks, since Todo list will be populated with translating Zend functionality to Laravel in the backend. Also frontend part will be going in the mobile direction where the templates which user can create should be mobile friendly and responsive.
There is a lot to rewrite here, but it should not be impossible to create something new and exciting...

# Translation

1. Fork this repository
2. Create branch on your fork for translation, for example 'german' branch
3. Create a new file in src/legacy/dev-application/languages/creator/  (if german than de.php - for other languages check what i18n locale you should use)
4. You should see all the strings for creator admin panel in src/legacy/dev-application/languages/creator/en.php, and for the website in src/legacy/dev-application/languages/en.php, use them for your language.
5. Commit the changes to your branch on your fork, and create a pull request.

Missing translations for those languages are generated in the *.php.missing files. To add the missing translations just insert your translation strings into their place in the .missing file.
